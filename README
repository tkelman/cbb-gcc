compiler building blocks: automated build scripts 
-------------------------------------------------

* a quick way to get started with cbb-gcc.
* a quick way to get started with cross-compilation for the midipix targets.
* pre-alpha, no fancy configurability... default locations are $HOME/midipix
  for the toolchain, and $HOME/temp for the workdir. To use different
  locations, please edit the script(s).
